My game is a 2D game inspired by the dino game where you have to jump over obstacles and reach a highscore .
This game is very simple but fun alloing the user to compete as the game get harder progressiely 
The game is a man who runs through a street and jumps over hurdles to get a highscore
i wasnt able to add the enemy because it was too complex a thing for me to do 
but this still is a challenging game with or without the enemys.
